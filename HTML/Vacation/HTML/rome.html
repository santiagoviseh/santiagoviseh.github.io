  <h5> <center> <font color="#FFFFFF">The Italian capital is an incredible place and if it is your first time in the country, it should definitely be the starting point of your trip to Italy. Rome is a fabulous mix of history, archeology, art, religion and religious culture and delicious food; and it certainly is the most popular place to visit in Italy.</font> </center> </h5>
  <h5><font color="#FFFFFF">What is in Roma?</font></h5>
  <h5><center><font color="#FFFFFF"> Perhaps the most recognizable symbol of ancient Rome, the Colosseum is a sight to behold and needs no introduction. Funded by spoils of war, the biggest amphitheater ever built held numerous sporting events and gladiator battles for half a millennium. Nowadays, you can visit the ancient arena and soak up its chilling history, but make sure you get your ticket in advance, as lines can get long during peak periods! Ain’t nobody got time for that.Built almost 2,000 years ago, the Pantheon (literally) still stands the test of time, proving Ancient Rome’s architectural ingenuity and its development in concrete technology. In fact, the structure’s massive rotunda is still the largest unreinforced dome made entirely of cement in existence. The entrance is free of charge, but for a more informative experience of this former temple, we highly recommend picking up an audio guide.</font></center></h5>
