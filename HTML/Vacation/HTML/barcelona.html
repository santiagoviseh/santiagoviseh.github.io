  <h5><font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I want to go there?</font></h5>
  <h5> <center> <font color="#FFFFFF">There are few cities in Europe where you can enjoy the culture and vibrancy of a city break with the fun and relaxation of a beach holiday, yet Barcelona offers the best of both worlds, thanks to its location right on the Mediterranean coastline.</font> </center> </h5>
  <h5><font color="#FFFFFF">What is in Barcelona?</font></h5>
  <h5><center><font color="#FFFFFF">Barcelona, the cosmopolitan capital of Spain’s Catalonia region, is known for its art and architecture. The fantastical Sagrada Família church and other modernist landmarks designed by Antoni Gaudí dot the city. Museu Picasso and Fundació Joan Miró feature modern art by their namesakes. City history museum MUHBA, includes several Roman archaeological sites. </font></center></h5>
